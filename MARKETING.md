# Woo Data Playground: Python PDF Utility Scripts

üöÄ **Dive into the Data!** üöÄ

Welcome to the Woo Data Playground, a repository dedicated to efficient PDF document processing using Python.
If you've been on the hunt for robust, streamlined, and powerful Python tools tailored for PDF processing, you've just hit gold!
From seamless downloading to extracting intricate details and even implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) for advanced content categorization, we've got you covered.

With Woo Data Playground, we've blended innovation with utility. Brace yourself for a transformative PDF experience that goes beyond the conventional!

## **Overview**

Offering a smorgasbord of Python scripts, each tailored for specific PDF-related tasks, this repository is your passport to PDF mastery. We've distilled complex processes into user-friendly tools to ensure your journey from massive PDFs to identifiable sub-documents is a breeze.

**Key Features**:
- üìò Cleverly dissect vast PDFs into digestible sub-documents.
- üîç Extract, classify, and interpret content using the power of NER.
- üí° Explore below for a detailed walkthrough of each utility.

## **Prerequisites**

Ensure the following prerequisites are set up before proceeding:

- Python 3.x
- Tesseract OCR

**Installing Necessary Libraries**:

You can install PyMuPDF, Flair, Pandas, and OpenPyXL using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Workflow and Rationale**

The core objective is to segment older publications from [wobcovid19.rijksoverheid.nl](https://wobcovid19.rijksoverheid.nl/) and upload them to [open.minvws.nl](https://open.minvws.nl/), splitting them based on original or local document IDs. Do note, the quality variance among these PDFs is considerable.

The included NER scripts aim to enhance search engine optimization. Given the data's presence in the repository, it's harnessed further for these capabilities.

## **Utilities**

### **PDF Downloader and Data Extraction Script**

- **Function**: Fetch JSON data from [wobcovid19.rijksoverheid.nl](https://wobcovid19.rijksoverheid.nl/), derive link-title pairs, download related PDFs, organize into folders, and record title data into a CSV file.
- **Implementation**: Utilizes `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `csv` libraries.

**For more details**, refer to the [PDF Downloader](download_pdfs.md) documentation.

### **PDF Table of Contents Extractor**

- **Function**: Extract the table of contents from a PDF, with an option to save to an Excel file.
  
```bash
python naive_section_finder.py <pdf_file> [--output-file output.xlsx]
```

### **PDF Document ID Extractor**

- **Function**: Extract DocumentIDs (numeric or alphanumeric) from PDFs.
  
```bash
python find_document_id.py <pdf_file> [--output-file output.xlsx]
```

**For more details**, check the [document_ids](document_ids.md) guide.

### **Named Entity Recognition (NER) Benchmark**

- **Function**: Execute NER using Flair's pretrained models and measure NER performance.

```bash
python ner-benchmark.py [--cuda]
```

### **Named Entity Recognition (NER) from PDFs**

- **Function**: Read a PDF and execute NER, saving results to either Excel or CSV.

```bash
python ner.py <pdf_file> [--cuda] [--certainty 0.9] [--output-excel output.xlsx] [--output-csv output.csv]
```

**For more details**, consult the [named entity recognition](named_entity_recognition.md) guide.

### **Combine and Sort CSV Files**

- **Function**: Merge and order multiple CSVs, ideal for combining various CSVs with entity data into one organized file.

```bash
python merge_ner_csvs.py <input_files> [--output combined_and_sorted.csv]
```
